## Project Description  
This sound project was created for the Communications Lab class. The primary goal was to explore audio storytelling by learning to use editing software, mastering recording equipment, and ultimately telling a compelling story through sound alone.

The concept is centered on **dreams**—not only as dreams during sleep, but also as aspirations. Our story focuses on the fear that holds people back from chasing those dreams until the very last moment.

The narrative follows a young girl who dreams of becoming a pianist but hesitates to take the first step. One night, she experiences a nightmare in which she makes a mistake during a performance. This intense dream, combined with a short conversation with her mother, motivates her to finally begin working toward her goal.

We aimed to make listeners feel the girl’s inner world—her doubt, fear, and determination—using sound effects like heavy breathing, audio distortions, piano music, and internal monologues to reflect her emotional state.

## Inspiration & Story Development  
The story was shaped through the collaborative ideas of **Asini, Nigina**, and **Amelia**:

- Nigina started with a short story about a girl thinking she lost her mom, only to wake up and realize it was just a nightmare.
- Asini wanted to add a motivational element, inspired by a video she saw on Instagram giving advice to confused college students.
- Amelia brought in a creative writing prompt from another class: “Are dreams real?” and the answer, “Tomorrow.” This idea helped tie together both meanings of "dream."

Amelia combined all these inspirations into a final script where a nightmare becomes the trigger for real-life growth. The title *Tomorrow is Now* reflects the shift from fear to action.

## Process  

### Script & Planning  
- The script was written by Amelia and included detailed notes on sound cues to guide the editing process.
- A visual mood board was created to set the tone for the project.

### Web Design  
- A wireframe for the website was designed in Canva by Nigina.
- Asini and Aakif collaborated to build the site based on that wireframe, creating a dreamy, surreal design to enhance the audio’s mood.

### Sound Recording & Editing  
- Nigina collected and organized free sound effects from YouTube and freesound.org, renaming and categorizing them in Google Drive.
- She also played and recorded the piano sections.
- Nigina and Amelia voiced the characters and recorded the audio in the drum room after testing different spaces for sound quality.
- Amelia edited and mixed the audio in **Audacity**, completing the final version in about two afternoons.

## Reflection & Evaluation  
We originally planned to build an interactive, feature-rich website. But as the project evolved, we realized the emotional quality of the audio was more important. By focusing on immersive storytelling through sound, we were able to create a more powerful experience.

Careful planning—like marking sound cues in the script—made the entire process smoother. Even though the website wasn’t the centerpiece, its thoughtful design helped highlight the audio and made the experience more engaging.
