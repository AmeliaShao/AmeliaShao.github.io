# Dreamscape – Audio Storytelling Project

## Overview  
This project is a collaboration between Asini, Nigina, and me (Amelia). We created a short, immersive audio story that explores a twisty, slightly eerie dream experience with an uplifting ending.

## Inspiration  
The story idea came from our combined inputs:

- **Nigina** wrote an initial story about a girl getting lost and separated from her mom, only to wake up and realize it was just a nightmare.
- **Asini** wanted to add a motivational element, inspired by a video she saw on Instagram that gives advice to confused college girls.
- I was inspired by a prompt from another class: I was randomly given the question “Are dreams real?” and the answer “Tomorrow.” I wanted to build a story around that philosophical idea using both meanings of the word "dream" (as in dream/nightmare and goal/hope).

I combined these ideas into a final version about a girl who wakes up from a scary nightmare and finds strength from it.

## Our Process  

### Script & Planning  
- I wrote the final script and marked where each sound effect or background sound should appear.
- This early planning made the following steps much easier.

### Sound Recording & Collection  
- Nigina searched for sound effects, renamed and organized them into folders on Google Drive.
- She also played and recorded the piano part for the story.
- Nigina and I did the voice acting for the mother and daughter characters.
- We tested different rooms and chose the drum room to avoid echo and background noise for recording.

### Audio Editing  
- I used **Audacity** to edit and mix the audio.
- The editing took about two afternoons, and thanks to our preparation, there were no major issues.

### Website Development  
- Asini and Aakif developed the website using our wireframe and a Canva mockup made by Nigina.
- The site has a dreamy, surreal design that fits perfectly with the theme and enhances the storytelling.

## Reflection  
- Good early planning (like marking sound cues in the script) really helped make the whole project smoother.
- Even though the website wasn't the main focus, its thoughtful design really boosted the mood and immersion of the audio piece.

## Tools Used  
- **Audacity** – Audio editing  
- **Google Drive** – File sharing and sound organization  
- **Canva** – Web design mockup  
- **HTML/CSS/JS** – Website development
