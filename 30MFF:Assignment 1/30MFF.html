        <p>In the library, the artist picks up a book titled Gulf, a poignant and tragic story,</p>

<!--Interpretation-->
<div class="text-container">
<h3>Interpretation</h3>
<p>Overall, this is a story about fame, identity, and self-loss, exploring whether one can still see their true self when overwhelmed by external expectations. The protagonists—both the artist and the woman in her painting—are surrounded by stars. The artist is seen as a rising star with a bright future, but she begins to question her situation, leading to the creation of this piece.</p>
<p>The ending is beautiful, quiet, and open-ended. Has the artist freed herself from the burden of this star image, or has she chosen to accept it? The painting's smile carries an ambiguous meaning—does it represent relief, submission, or silent resistance?</p>

<p>The story was originally conceived by Shamsa under the theme "A Day in the Life of an Artist," intended as a vlog-style film. However, during the shooting process, we adjusted the narrative based on Shamsas painting, hoping to create space for reflection within our means. These reflections resonate with us as students at a prestigious university, and we are glad to have had the chance to express them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, due to time constraints, many ideas could not be fully realized. We spent about 40 minutes filming and 20 minutes editing. The final editing process was intense—Shamsa and I barely had the chance to communicate (she was reshooting the last scene), but our prior discussions ensured we were aligned. I'm thrilled that the final result reflects both of our visions.</p>
<p>All in all, I personally love this piece and am grateful to have collaborated with such a thoughtful and capable artist like Shamsa.</p>
