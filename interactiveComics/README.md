# Eat Gravity
## Idea Formulation
When the professor said “Now you can go find your team”, a totally random thought popped into my head: What if the apple that fell on Newton’s head never led to any deep thinking—what if he just took a bite and ate it instead? Maybe it’s because I had an apple this morning, or maybe for some other reason, but I suddenly found myself entertaining this slightly absurd, meme-like idea and wondering if it could work as an interactive comic.  
  
I turned to my teammates—who were meeting together for the first time—and shared this idea. For me, it was just a fun icebreaker, not something I actually planned to build our final project on. But to my surprise, my teammates really liked it! We immediately started thinking about how to expand this GIF (at least that’s how I imagined it) into a six-panel comic.  
  
Since I was the one who came up with the story, I took the initiative to write the script—even though I’m not great at drawing. That night, I looked up some cartoon versions of Newton and sketched out a rough storyboard on my iPad.

During class, our team discussed and refined some key details, like having Newton disappear in the fourth panel while the apple takes center stage.  
## Execution
The next step was execution. We broke down the different elements and started searching online for reference images to turn into SVG files, making them easier to use in coding later. We also made sure to align on the art style before splitting up the tracing work.
  
Later, we met up in person again to check our progress and divide the work further. We fleshed out the full storyline, added text to highlight the main idea, and included some comic-style expressions, like sound effects. After that, I created a basic wireframe to map out the interaction elements and page flow (to be honest, the content was pretty simple… but I accidentally lost the sketch…oops).
  
Next, I handled the basic HTML and CSS setup, while the two guys on my team volunteered to take care of the JavaScript. But after a second meeting, we decided to do this in another way. 
  
After Mustafa finished editing the overall look of each page in Illustrator, we divided up the coding tasks for all six panels. I was in charge of the first and second pages, where the apple falls and hits Newton on the head. It took me a bit of time to figure out the relationship between the “background” and the “changing elements,” and exported the SVG files separately. With the help of ChatGPT and some online resources, I managed to get it working. The rest of the panels were handled by my teammates.

That’s pretty much the whole process. Huge thanks to Mustafa for taking over the illustrator and code merging part! It’s a lot of work.
## Reflection
From my perspective, a six-panel comic doesn’t have to be too deep—I just wanted it to be a lighthearted, slightly playful, and not-so-serious little story. After all, Newton was just a regular person. And when a regular person gets hit on the head with an apple, isn’t their first reaction to get annoyed… and then just eat it?
  
On another note, as we discussed in class, memes have a huge influence on culture and design, and this project is no exception. I’m pretty sure I must have seen a similar meme or joke somewhere before, which is why this idea popped into my head. I haven’t read many comics in recent years, but as a kid, I read a lot of (if I remember correctly) Korean educational comics—things like Egyptian Adventures or South African Treasure Hunt. I don’t remember much of the actual knowledge from those books, but I do remember some of the funny moments with the characters.

All of that somehow came together to shape this story. As the “scriptwriter,” I hope you all enjoy this random idea!
