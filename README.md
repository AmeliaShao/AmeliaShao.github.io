# The Shining Star Documentation
## Project Name:
30 Minutes Film Festival: The Shining Star, by Amelia & Shamsa
## Project Description:
This is an original student project consisting of two parts, a video and a website. The video is 1 minute and 35 seconds long, created within one hour from nothing. The video is about an artist who is seen as a "genius/star" by others. They create a painting of a girl who is also blinded by the "shining star" title. It's a metaphorical piece full of deeper meaning.  
The website was created later to host the video and place some thoughts that the video creator, Amelia, wanted to express. I hope this webpage helps viewers understand my interpretation of the video and evoke their own thoughts on the topic of “star/genious”. The gradient background from light to dark and the falling stars highlight the theme, while the yellow font adds to the late-night atmosphere. Together, they match the video’s somewhat heavy theme.
## Process:
### Video:
- Decide the theme: There was no restriction on the theme, and I don’t have any specific idea at the moment. (Though I did want to make a thriller about one who lost their way in the Art Center… It indeed was a maze to me!) And then my teammate Shamsa said something like, “Well, I’m an artist. Do you think ‘a day of an artist’ will work?” I was personally jealous of any artists because I was not, but I would be happy to see that. So we started with the idea of creating a vlog-like video to show a day of Shamsa, as an artist.
- Setting: Since Shamsa needed to draw, we planned to find a big piece of paper, but it would be hard to shoot without a tripod. I proposed to use a whiteboard instead, so we set off to find a proper one. We ended up using the music room next door to our classroom, which even had a piano as we demanded!
- Theme changed: In that room, we planned out shoots we would take. ![BTS_notes](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f2612c5f-b292-41e2-950a-a7e9e1d3ca38) As you can see from the draft, we planned to include pianoing, drawing, coding, and library visiting. However, when Shamsa started to draw a girl whose eyes were covered, we all agreed that this video could go deeper. Thinking of the star pendant on Shamsa’s bag, the title “The Shining Star” came to mind—the artist who is drawing the girl is regarded as a genius, and she is drawing someone who looks like a “star” student. The dual metaphor was our intention.
- Shooting: The piano, drawing, and visiting the library were the three main shots at last, each with some indications we wanted to express. After finishing the first two in around 25 minutes, we ran to the library for the shoot that revealed the artist’s identity as the “star/genius”. Unfortunately, Shamsa failed to find the book she read that would more directly uncover our metaphor. We got the book Gulf instead, which is a poignant and tragic story as well.
- Editing: I only had less than 20 minutes to do all the organizing and editing jobs. We agreed immediately to use Howl's Moving Castle as the background music. Downloaded through YouTube, Shamsa ran to the music room to take a final shot of the painting and cleaned up things, while I was sitting there viewing footage and clicking the touchpad the fastest I had ever been. It was so stressful seeing the video rendering so slowly when the clock was ticking so fast. But we made it!!!

### Website:

- Content: The unique part of my design is adding keyframes and interpretations. This is because our work isn’t a straightforward story—I wanted to use the website to better convey my thoughts during the creative process. (Shamsa’s interpretation might be different from mine, but that’s exactly the effect we wanted from the start.)
- Decoration: The whole color platter is in reference to the dark starry sky. I decided early on to include star elements to match the "shining star" theme. I designed the stars to fall as you scroll down, symbolizing that the bright stars we see might actually be falling. The background was originally a solid dark blue, but I felt it was too plain. Changing it to a gradient from light to dark also helps express the “deepening” struggles of “geniuses.”
- Coding: I referenced W3Schools a lot, along with class examples and various online resources like SheCodes, adapting them to fit our project. Shamsa got stuck for a long time on embedding the YouTube video, but luckily, after some teamwork (and a bit of confusion), we managed to solve it.

## Reflection/Evaluation: 
As expected, the final result turned out a bit different from my original design, especially in terms of layout, which ended up being slightly simplified. Initially, I sketched out the wireframe like this, but my roommate, who took Commlab, reminded me that having so many elements side by side could be hard to implement.

After trying it out, I realized they were right. I figured out a way to place the keyframe and annotations side by side but eventually gave up on the later multi-column asymmetrical design. If I had more time, I would definitely give it another shot.  
As for JavaScript, I found it quite challenging but also really fun. Unfortunately, I couldn’t come up with more interesting interactive designs using JavaScript this time, but I’m sure I’ll have more chances to explore in the future.
